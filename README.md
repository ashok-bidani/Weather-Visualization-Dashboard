## Weather Visualization Dashboard
Created a web dashboard showcasing weather visualizations produced in the 'World Cities Weather' project. Website is hosted through Github Pages: https://ashok-bidani.github.io/Weather-Visualization-Dashboard/.

## Content

 - Project Summary page: landing page with project summary, 'Visualizations' sidebar which allows the user to click on a particular plot of interest, and navigation menu including 'Plots', 'Comparison', and 'Data'. The landing page also provides the option to view on a mobile or tablet (ie. smaller screen) using Bootstrap responsive components.

 - Comparison page: page with the four plots or visualizations (Maximum Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness, and Wind Speed vs. Latitude)

 - Data page: page containing a comprehensive table of the data used in this project.

Here is a video demonstrating use and navigation through the dashboard.
